# Semantic-Similarity
Semantic similarity refers to two or more phrases which mean the same, but are represented in
different words. It is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing to find sentences or
questions that are similar in meaning. We often come across discussion forums where different
users are seeking answers for similar questions. To help the forum understand that these questions
are semantically similar and should be answered the same way, we need to calculate the semantic
similarity between them.

We have chosen the Kaggle Quora Question Pairs dataset. Each row of the
dataset contains a question pair and a field “isDuplicate” which denotes whether the two sentences
are semantically similar or not. The aim of the project is to analyze pairs of questions and
implement different approaches to classify them as semantically similar or not.
